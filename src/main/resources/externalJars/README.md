### Polystore.jar
Polystore.jar is used to query PostreSQL and MongoDB. It handles all the different DBMS as a single polystore system, allowing to query both databases with a single SQL query and retreaving the results as a single JSON.  
The project was developed by the authors of this one and it is possible to find a brief hitory [HERE](https://github.com/leorossi96/Polystore). Unfortunately this github repository is no longer mantained and we suggest using the version of the jar packed here. 

### unityjdbc.jar & mongodb_unityjdbc_full.jar
Those are Polystore.jar dependencies. Those are free trial version and are developed by **UnityJDBC**. For further information we suggest visiting [http://www.unityjdbc.com](http://www.unityjdbc.com/).
